## About me

I am a positive-thinking person who enjoys learning new subjects and applying the knowledge to build something new. I am attentive to details and value order and structure in any work. I find communication with people and solving problems as a team extremely important due to my previous experience. My favorite thought is, ‘Only together can we achieve greatness.’

Besides being involved in manual and automation software testing, I enjoy writing code in Python and building robots as my hobby. During my free time, I constantly study different tools using books I find in my library and online documentation. I often test my knowledge by testing web applications created for learning purposes as well as coding exercises.

I would be thrilled to use my acquired knowledge in testing a functional product and gaining practical experience. This is an essential step towards my career objective of becoming a mid-level software tester within the next few years.
